At GE Capital we're not just bankers, we're builders. We provide smart 
financing and the know-how of GE to help our customers' capital go 
further and do more. Your company is building something and we get that. 
What you're building takes money, but it may also need knowledge and 
expertise. This is where we come in.
GE Capital is an extension of GE's rich heritage of building and 
supporting growth. Investing in the sectors we know best, we can provide 
more than just financing: We bring insight, knowledge and expertise to 
every loan. And as a result, businesses that finance with GE Capital 
benefit from the global know-how and expertise of GE. Around the world, 
we're helping our customers to invent more, to make more, to sell more 
and to do it all with greater efficiency. We're helping companies in 
ways that no other bank can.
